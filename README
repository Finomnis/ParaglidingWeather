# ParaglidingWeather

This website is a frontend for https://meteo-parapente.com/

Reasoning is that the thermal data provided at meteo-parapente is great, it's just missing a simple and easy overview.
Therefore this page got created.

The only thing added is the föhn data, which gets derived from the pressure difference between Innsbruck and Bozen (for Austria), and Lugano and Zürich (for Switzerland).
